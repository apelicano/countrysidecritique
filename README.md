# 🍃 Ghibli Poster Generator

This is a whimsical, HTML+CSS-based motivational/art poster styled to evoke the dreamy nostalgia of countryside scenes in Studio Ghibli films — particularly _My Neighbor Totoro_.

It features:
- A responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- A rotating set of semi-pretentious art critique quotes
- An easy-to-replace background image
- Gentle serif typography (Spectral)

## 🖼️ To Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Replace the placeholder `your-image.jpg` in the `<img>` tag with your own photo (ideally a countryside scene or similar aesthetic).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## 🧠 Why
This project began as a joke between family members about how modern countryside photos in Japan look like anime backgrounds. It evolved into a loving parody of art school critique language — the kind you'd hear in Numberblocks meets Ghibli.

## ✨ Sample Quotes
> "I love the juxtaposition of the upright concrete utility poles against the soft geometry of the rice fields..."

> "This isn’t a photo of a place; it’s a negotiation between time periods that haven’t met yet."

> "Even the weeds by the roadside are curated. That’s not overgrowth — that’s intentional chaos."

## 🛠️ Customizing
Want to add your own quotes? Open the `<script>` block and modify the `quotes` array.

Want to change the font or layout? Everything's in `index.html` and embedded CSS.

Enjoy your art critique era. 🌾
